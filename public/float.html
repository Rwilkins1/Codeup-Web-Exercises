			Now, you see, this right here is sample text. It is really just here to take up space so I can practice using float elements. No other purpose other than that. Like, I swear. That is really all there is to this paragraph. Don't try to find any hidden meaning or anything like that. There isn't any hidden meaning. It is just here to provide an obstacle around which to position things, and it needs to be long enough to make it a bit of a challenge.
